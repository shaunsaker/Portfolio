Hi, I'm a Web Developer from South Africa with a passion for creating clean, functional, responsive web applications. I started my coding journey a couple of months ago and will never look back! I have now made it my mission to prevent others from making the mistakes I made coming out of High School and choosing careers that actually had little interest to me (besides financial reward - which definitely does not equal happiness!). I will do this by creating a web application that first assesses a user's interests and then provides ways to 'test' the choice in the real world. For obvious reasons, the details of the app will only be revealed once I have completed a first commit. But first stop, Front End Web Development.
